# CAR-PRICES-PREDICTION-Oasis-Infobyte-PROJECTTHREE
I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices using features like mileage, age, and engine size. 

Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project leverages Scikit-learn with Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest regressors for accurate predictions.
